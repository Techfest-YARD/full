Getting Started with Git
-------------------------
This chapter covers the basics of Git. You will learn about version control, installing Git, and getting started with managing your source code.

About Version Control
---------------------
Version control records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is essential for collaboration and recovering previous states.

Local and Centralized VCS
-------------------------
Local VCS methods (like copying files) can be error prone, while centralized systems (like CVS or Subversion) manage changes on a single server, which can be a single point of failure.

Distributed Version Control Systems
-------------------------------------
Distributed systems such as Git give each user a full copy of the repository, increasing reliability and flexibility.

A Short History of Git
----------------------
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the Linux kernel project. It is fast, efficient, and offers robust branching capabilities.

Git Fundamentals
----------------
- Snapshots, Not Differences: Git stores snapshots of your files.
- Local Operations: Most operations occur locally, ensuring speed.
- Data Integrity: Git uses SHA-1 hashing to verify data.
- Three States: Files can be Modified, Staged, or Committed.

Basic Git Workflow
------------------
1. Modify files in your working directory.
2. Stage the changes you want to include.
3. Commit the staged changes to record a snapshot.
